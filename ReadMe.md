Arduino_Servo code sets up input pins for sensing and feedback
and output pins for motors and required outputs for sensors
to enable a bimodal Arduino-controlled robot. In conjunction
with mechanical switches on the robot chassis, a manual drive
mode is possible via a hacked NES controller, and an automatic
drive mode makes use of leaf switch bumpers, an ultrasonic
distance sensor, and an infrared proximity sensor to avoid
collisions.
